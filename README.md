# StarChat

## StarChat in brief
* StarChat is a service for the implementation of workflow based chatbot.

* StarChat provide a restful service to implement conversational agents.

* StarChat is under development and every contribution is welcome.

## What problem StarChat is solving

* StarChat solves the problem of specifying a conversational flow with actionable states and templates, it also solves the pattern matching and retrieval problem with the identification of the closest concept in the workflow in relation with the user input.

* StarChat must scale horizontally with the instantiation of new services without any service interruption.
The deployment must be easy

* StarChat offers a means to store and retrieve the conversations in consistent way and suitable to perform data analysis.

* StarChat implements a state machine mechanism to guide the user in the conversation and to perform actions in relation of the user inputs.
* When no answer is found in the workflow of the state machine, the system, optionally, can fall back to the knowledge base provided by the collection of conversation of the customer service operators.
* Chat is developed using [akka](http://akka.io).
* Chat it is stateless to work in parallel with as many instances as you need. It is configurable by a simple configuration file and it is containerized with docker: deployment require few minutes!

## How does StarChat work?

* StarChat stores the conversations on a search engine with special configuration to handle the language of the bot

* A special table of the search engine is reserved for the state machine.

* The state machine allows to specify templated sentences to send personalized messages to the user

* When the user enters a phrase, StarChat search the closest match in the state machine and guide the conversation from a state to another.

* When no state matches the input text, optionally, *Chat searches on the knowledge base built with the past conversations.

## Customization of StarChat

* StarChat rely on [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) for storing data and for the retrieval functionalities.
Is straightforward to customize the elasticsearch schema for new languages
and adding new analyzers or new fields.

# System Design

## The data schema

* StarChat uses two data types on the same index:
    * state type : for the storage of the state machine, the fields are the following
        * state : the name of the state 
        * queries : the list of queries which trigger the state e.g. ["cannot access account", "problem access account"],
        * bubble : the text to show to the user on UI
        * action : the name of a function to call (implemented by the client)  
        * action_input : a dictionary (key,value) with the parameters of the function (implemented by the client)
        * success_value : the destination state if the action function fail succeed  
        * failure_value : the destination state if the action function fail
    * question type : to store the conversations in question/answer format, the fields are the following
        * doctype: specify a type for the documents
        * state: eventual link to any of the state machine states, useful to redirect the user
        to a path of the state machine 
        * verified: was the conversation verified by an operator?
        * conversation: ID of the conversation (multiple q&a may be inside a conversation)
        * topics: eventually done with LDM or similar
        * question: usually what the user of the chat says
        * answer: usually what the operator of the chat says
        * status: tell whether the document is locked for editing or not, useful for a GUI to avoid concurrent modifications

## The Rest endpoint

The StarChat REST service stands in the middle between the CLIENT which implement the BOT UI
and the dataset and it provide data intelligence.

The behaviour of the state machine is specified
by a csv called **SYSTEM TEMPLATE SCRIPT** which has the format:

* **(R)**: means return value, this field is returned by the REST function
* **(T)**: indicates conversational triggers to the state.
* **(I)**: means internal, this field is not exposed to the API

The csv contains the following columns:

* **state**: a unique name of the state
* **bubble (R)**: the output to be shown to the user, when empty nothing is to be shown. The bubble is a string which may contains template variables like %email% or %link%. The client is responsible to provide these functions
* **action (R)**: a function to be called on the client side. The user is responsible of the implementation of these actions, see Client functions
* **action_input (R)**: this is the input passed to the function in "Action". The text might contains template variables. see get_next_response
* **success_value (R)** (instructions for client): output to return in case of success
* **failure_value (R)** (instructions for client): output to return in case of failure
* **query (T,I)**: this is a list of queries which should trigger the state

## Client functions

The client should implement at least the following set of functions:

* show_buttons: tell the client to render a multiple choice button
    * input: a key/value pair with the key indicating the text to be shown in the button, and the value indicating the state to follow e.g.: {"Forgot Password": "forgot_password", "Account locked": "account_locked", "Specify your problem": "specify_problem", "I want to call an operator": "call_operator", "None of the above": "start"}
    * output: the choice related to the button clicked by the user e.g.: "account_locked"
* input_form: render an input form or collect the input following a specific format
    * input: a dictionary with the list of fields and the type of fields, at least "email" must be supported: e.g.: { "email": "email" } where the key is the name and the value is the type
    * output: a dictionary with the input values e.g.: { "email": "a@b.com" }
* send_password_generation_link: send an email with instructions to regenerate the password
    * input: a valid email address e.g.: "a@b.com"
    * output: a dictionary with the response fields e.g.: { "user_id": "123", "current_state": "forgot_password", "status": "true" }

Other application specific functions can be implemented by the client these functions must be called with the prefix
"priv_" e.g. "priv_retrieve_user_transactions"

See the file doc/sample_state_machine_specification.csv for a sample of the state machine specification.

# Mechanics

* The client implements the functions which appear in the action field of the spreadsheet. We will provide interfaces.
* The client call the rest API "decisiontable" endpoint communicating a state if any, the user input data and other
state variables
* The client receive a response with guidance on what to return to the user and what are the possible next steps
* The client render the message to the user and eventually collect the input, then call again the system to get
instructions on what to do next
* When the "decisiontable" functions does not return any results the user can call the "knowledgebase" endpoint
which contains all the conversations.

    *  meaning: bad request data, the input data is formally valid but there is some issue with data interpretation
    * output data: the output data structure is a json dictionary with two fields: code and message. The following code are supported:
        * code: 100

# Build and run the service 

## run directly in the build environment
 
Clone the repository and enter the starchat directory.

Initialize the elasticsearch instance.

Run the service:

```bash
sbt compile run
```

The service binds on the port 8888 by default.

# Setup 

## docker

* Generate a packet distribution
```bash
sbt dist
```

* Extract the packet into the docker-starchat folder
```bash
unzip target/universal/starchat-0.1.zip && mv starchat-0.1 docker-starchat
```

* Enter the directory docker-starchat 
```bash
cd  docker-starchat
```

* Review the configuration files
      
      * Edit the file starchat-0.1/config/application.conf and modify the ip where elasticsearch is bind
* Run the services (both startchat and elasticsearch)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After these steps the services will be up and running and you can initialize the ES schemas.

##Prepare ES

* Enter the directory scripts/index_management/\<lang\> e.g. enter the directory scripts/index_management/english 
* Create the analyzers
```bash
./create_analyzer.sh
```

* Create the data types
```bash
./set_question_type.sh
./set_state_type.sh
```

##Test

A set of test script is present inside scripts/api_test
